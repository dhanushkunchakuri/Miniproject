**Summary of Search Results**

The search query was about Chandrababu Naidu's claim that animal fat, specifically beef tallow or fish oil, is used in preparing Tirupati Laddu, a prasadam made by the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple (TTD) in Andhra Pradesh. The search results show that TTD officials have denied this claim and highlighted their rigorous quality control measures for ghee procurement.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Ghee Procurement:** TTD procures about 15 tonnes of cow ghee per day through e-tenders, with four different tenders issued every six months.
2. **Quality Control Measures:** Every consignment of ghee is subjected to wet chemistry testing at the TTD laboratory to ensure quality standards are met. If a consignment fails to meet these standards, it is rejected.
3. **FSSAI Specified Tests:** To enhance quality checks for ghee procurement, the report suggests performing Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) specified tests for beta-sitosterol and fatty acid composition using RP-HPLC and GC-FID respectively.
4. **Blacklisted Firms:** Several firms that have repeatedly sent subpar or adulterated products have been blacklisted permanently from participating in the tender process to supply ghee.

**Additional Information:**

* The majority of firms supplying ghee to TTD have been doing so for decades, spanning both TDP and YSRCP regimes.
* Premium Foods, Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh); Alpha Milk Foods, Hatras (Uttar Pradesh); Karnal Milk Foods, Haryana; KMF (Karnataka); Aavin (Tamil Nadu); Visakha Dairy, Vaishnavi Dairy, Parag Dairy, and Tirumala Dairy from Andhra Pradesh have been the suppliers during both regimes.
* Vanaspati, Dalda or plant fats are added to ghee by some vendors since they are cheaper and also enhance shelf life. However, TTD rejects any consignment that contains adulterated ghee.

**Conclusion:**

The search results show that Chandrababu Naidu's claim about using animal fat in Tirupati Laddu preparation is not supported by evidence from the TTD officials or their quality control measures. The rigorous testing and rejection of subpar consignments ensure that only high-quality ghee is used in preparing Tirupati Laddu.
